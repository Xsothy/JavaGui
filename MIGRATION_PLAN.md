# Migration Plan for Component-Based Architecture

This document outlines the steps to complete the migration to a fully component-based architecture.

## Current Status

We have:
- Created a `Router` class in the `Support` package
- Created basic components in the `Components` package:
  - `StaffPanel`
  - `StaffDetailsPanel`
  - `StaffFormPanel`
  - `ExpensePanel`
  - `ExpenseFormPanel`
- Updated the `Dashboard` to use these components

## Next Steps

### 1. Fix Package Structure Issues

- Update all package declarations to match the correct package structure
- Fix import statements throughout the codebase
- Ensure all classes are in the appropriate packages

### 2. Complete Component Migration

- Fully implement the `ExpenseFormPanel` to replace `frmExpenseAdd`
- Create any other needed components for complex UI elements
- Remove unused class files once their functionality has been migrated to components

### 3. Resolve Linter Errors

- Fix package-related linter errors
- Address any missing imports or class references
- Ensure proper exception handling in all components

### 4. Testing

- Test all navigation flows
- Test all CRUD operations for both staff and expenses
- Verify that the UI is responsive and behaves as expected

### 5. Cleanup

- Remove deprecated files:
  - `frmStaffView.java`
  - `frmStaffDetailsView.java`
  - `frmExpenseView.java`
  - `frmExpenseAdd.java`
  - Any other unused form classes

### 6. Documentation

- Update JavaDoc comments for all new components
- Complete the README.md with additional details
- Add comments to any complex code sections

## Implementation Notes

1. When creating new components, follow the established pattern:
   - Accept a parent component in the constructor
   - Use the Router for navigation
   - Implement a consistent look and feel

2. For component interactions:
   - Use event listeners for communication between components
   - Pass necessary data through constructors or setter methods
   - Avoid global state when possible

3. For code organization:
   - Keep UI logic in the components
   - Keep business logic in the controllers
   - Keep data access in the repositories
